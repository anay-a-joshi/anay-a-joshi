Hey!
I am Anay Joshi from Kolhapur, Maharashtra in India. My major is Computer Science, and I am part of the University Honors Program at the University of Cincinnati. I did my co-op(s) at one of the tech giants in Sunnyvale, California as a Software Developer Intern. Moreover, I am also a proud presidential member of the National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS). Beyond the intricacies of coding and algorithms, I love traveling to different places, and in my free time, I enjoy driving my sports car and riding my cruiser bike.
